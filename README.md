# Franchise Management Case Study

A full-stack case study, showcasing a management system for **Franchises** and their related **Offices (Branches)**. The project demonstrates:

This project demonstrates:

- Clean, reusable frontend architecture
- Type-safe React + TypeScript patterns
- RESTful backend design with FastAPI
- Fully Dockerized local setup
- Real-world CRUD workflows

---

## Features

### Franchises

- Create, view, update, and delete franchises
- View franchise details in a reusable details modal
- Read-only → edit mode toggle using shared forms

### Offices (Branches)

- Create offices under a franchise
- View offices per franchise
- Update and delete offices
- Shared form logic for create / view / edit workflows

No local installation of PostgreSQL, Node.js, or Python is required when using Docker.

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CemOlmez/rteca-case-study.git
cd rteca-case-study
```

---

### 2. Run with Docker Compose

## Development Notes

- The frontend uses strict TypeScript checks and production builds
- Reusable UI components (Button, Select, Modal) extend native HTML props
- Forms are reused for create, read-only view, and edit modes
- Backend schemas, models, and frontend API types are aligned
- PostgreSQL data is persisted using Docker volumes

---

## Testing

Testing wasn't added

---

## Assumptions & Tradeoffs

- No authentication layer was added to keep the scope focused on CRUD operations
- No tests were included
- The project prioritizes clarity and correctness over feature depth
- Docker Compose is used for local orchestration only
- PostgreSQL data persists locally via Docker volumes but no cloud deployment was configured
- No frontend UI was optimized for mobile devices — focus was on desktop experience
